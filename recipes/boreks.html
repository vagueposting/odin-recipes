        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz feta cheese, grated</li>
            <li>8 oz mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>3 tbsp paarsley, chopped</li>
            <li>3 tbsp chives, chopped</li>
            <li>3 tbsp mint, chopped</li>
            <li>1 pinch nutmeg</li>
            <li>8 oz phyllo pastry</li>
            <li>3-4 tbsp melted butter</li>
            <li>salt and fresh ground pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 deg C. In a bowl, 
                blend the feta and mozzarella cheese with 
                the beaten eggs. Add the chopped herbs, 
                season with pepper and nutmeg and 
                stir well to mix.
            </li>
            <li>Cut the sheets of pastry into four 
                rectangular strips approximately 
                3 inches wide. Cover all but one or two 
                strips with a damp cloth to prevent 
                them from drying out.
            </li>
            <li>Brush on strip of pastry at a time 
                with a little melted butter. Place 1 tsp 
                filling at the bottom edge. Fold one corner 
                over the filling to make a triangle shape. 
                Continue folding the pastry over itself 
                until you get to the end of the strip. 
                Keep making triangles until all the 
                mixture is used up.
            </li>
            <li>Place the boreks on a greased baking sheet 
                and bake in the oven for about 30 minutes 
                or until golden brown.
            </li>
        </ol>
