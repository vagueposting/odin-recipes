        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cup sesame seeds</li>
            <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In short, you will need a 2:1 ratio of sesame seeds 
            and honey.</p>
        
        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Toast the sesame seeds. You can spread them in 
                a pan and put them in the oven at 325 degrees 
                Fahrenheit or you can toast them in a pan. 
                You want them to get a bit of color, but 
                not too brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the honey in medium sauce pan and heat 
                the honey until it starts to bubble. Let 
                it boil for 4-5 minutes. If you have a food 
                thermometer, you boil until honey reaches a 
                temperature of 125 deg C.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the toasted sesame seeds, lower the heat 
                and stir. Making sure all ingredients are 
                mixed well together. Heat the mixture for 2-3 
                minutes more (the more it cooks, the crunchier 
                it will be, but be careful of scorching.) To 
                check if it is ready, take a small amount 
                and drop it in a glass with water, it should 
                stay in a ball, if it spreads out it still needs 
                to be heated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Line a pan with slightly greased parchment paper 
                and pour the sesame mixture. Place another sheet 
                of parchment paper on top (also greased) and 
                spread out the sesame-honey mix with a rolling 
                pin. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the top sheet carefully and let it cool 
                for about 15 minutes. Cut into small bars.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let them cool completely. Remove and store 
                with parchment paper between them in airtight 
                container.
            </li>
        </ol>
