        <p>Italy may make you think of pasta and pizza, 
            but the ever-succulent Osso Buco is a rather 
            underrated potential star of the show for your 
            dinners. Traditionally, this recipe uses veal, 
            but since it's hard to come by in 
            my country, this site will use beef. 
            <b>Makes 4-6 servings.</b>

        <h3>For the Osso Buco</h3>

            <li>4 oz pancetta, diced into 1/4 in cubes</li>
            <li> 2 1/2 to 3 pounds beef shanks (2 to 3 in thick)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced carrot</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced celery</li>
            <li>1 medium onion</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chopped garlic</li>
            <li>3 to 4 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1 to 2 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>Flour for dusting the meat</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Gremolata</h3>
        <ul><li>2 tbsp Italian parsley</li>
            <li>1 tbsp finely-grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed and minced</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 160 deg C.</li>
            <li>Heat a dutch oven on 
                the stove top over medium heat for about 
                5 minutes. Add pancetta to pan, cook, stirring 
                occassionally.<br/>
                When the pancetta is crispy and most of the 
                fat has rendered (about 5 minutes of cooking), 
                remove the pancetta to a plate covered with 
                some paper towel and set aside.<br/>
                If necessary, drain off all but two tbsp of 
                the fat from the pan.
            </li>
            <li>Place the flour in a shallow bowl or 
                deep plate.<br/>
                Season the veal shank well with salt and 
                pepper. Dredge the veal shanks with some 
                flour, shake off any excess, and add the 
                meat to the hot fat in the pan.<br/>
                Increase the heat to medium high and cook 
                the shanks on each side until well-browned 
                (about 5 minutes per side). Remove the 
                shanks to a plate, set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Add the onions, carrots, and celery to 
                the Dutch oven. Cook the onion mixture, 
                stirring frequently, until the onions are 
                translucent and toss in the garlic and thyme.<br/>
                Continue cooking until the vegetables just 
                begin to brown.
            </li>
            <li>Add the shanks and the pancetta back to the 
                pan. Pour in the wine and then add enough 
                stock to come a little more than halfway 
                up the sides of the shanks.<br/>
                Bring to a simmer. Cover the pan and put it 
                in the oven to cook until the meat is tender, 
                about 60 to 90 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Combine the gremolata ingredients, place in 
                a separate small serving dish.<br/>
                Serve the osso buco on top of risotto 
                or polenta. Sprinkle with gremolata.
            </li>
        </ol>
